# Pseudo Boundary Tool

Given an any kind of Distribution Network this Automated tool can divide them into most appropriate boundary polygons covering it according to the User Requirements (Ex: - Feature length, Boundary Size).

**Input Pipeline layer** --> Output Boundary layer (File Geodatabase) 

**Threshold** --> approximate pipeline length required

**Gap Distance** --> maximum distance between two lines in single boundary polygon.


Ex: - These two line records will be automatically considered as inside two separate boundary polygons by the algorithm based on gap distance threshold.
